        <h4 id="write-up-question">Rationale for our design decisions:</h4>
        <p id="write-up-text">We went with an orange/red color theme to reflect the healthcare focus of the project and
            give the interface a professional, trustworthy look. Buttons, dropdowns, and info cards all have soft
            corners, good spacing, and light shadows to keep things looking clean and easy to read.
            The layout is pretty simple overall, with a few images and visual touches to keep it from feeling too plain.
            We wanted the focus to stay on the patient data, without anything too distracting. Interactive elements like
            buttons and tooltips respond smoothly, and the text scales well across different screen sizes.
            In the end, the design aims to feel professional and approachable, which supports the
            serious nature of the data while still being easy to use. </p>
        <h4 id="write-up-question">How did we choose our particular visual encodings and interaction techniques?</h4>
        <p id="write-up-text">Since we're working with time series data, we wanted to make it easy for users to explore
            glucose trends over time. To do that, we used a line graph as our main visual, mapping time to the x-axis
            and glucose levels to the y-axis. This layout puts all data on a consistent scale and helps users quickly
            spot high or low glucose values and see when they occurred.
            To make the chart more interactive, we added a vertical tracking bar and tooltip that follows the user's
            cursor, so as they scrub through the graph, they can instantly see the exact time and glucose reading at any
            point. We also overlaid semi-transparent dots along the line to mark meal times. These dots vary in size to
            reflect the amount of sugar in each meal, and hovering over them reveals details like the food items eaten
            and their sugar content. This gives users a clearer picture of the patient's diet and how different meals
            may be impacting glucose levels. The main goal of our visualization is to help viewers understand how a
            patient's HBA1c, their diabetic status, affects their blood glucose levels when they consume a specific
            food. Finally, we included a zoom feature that lets users take a closer look at specific glucose events
            during a particular time period.</p>
        <h4 id="write-up-question">What alternatives did we consider and how did we arrive at our ultimate choices?</h4>
        <p id="write-up-text">We considered using a brush selector to allow users to select multiple food events at
            once, but ultimately decided against it. We felt it added unnecessary visual clutter and didn't align well
            with our goal of keeping the interface clean and intuitive.
            We also explored using a brush tool for zooming, but instead opted for a simpler approach that lets users
            zoom in and out with their default scroll wheel. This method felt more responsive and familiar, providing a
            smoother experience when exploring the data.
            We wanted to include clear distinctions between these spikes and the time they a food item was consumed, we
            did think about doing bars to delineate when a food was consumed but since our main point relied less on
            food consumption and more on the level of the spike, we decided a dot would be sufficient.
        </p>
        <h4 id="write-up-question">An overview of our development process</h4>
        <p id="write-up-text">We kicked things off by meeting as a group to browse datasets from PhysioNet, looking for
            one we were all genuinely interested in. Each of us picked a few datasets and did some initial exploratory
            data analysis (EDA) on our own using Python. After that, we regrouped to share our findings, ideas, and
            visualizations.
            In the end, we agreed to use the <a href="https://physionet.org/content/big-ideas-glycemic-wearable/1.1.2/"
                target="_blank">Glycemic Variability and Wearable Device Data</a> from the BIG IDEAs Lab. Once
            we settled on the dataset, we started brainstorming how the visualization should look and how users would
            interact with it. Each group member sketched out ideas, and we came to a shared design direction that
            everyone liked.
            From there, we met again to divide the work evenly and set up a timeline with clear goals. Once development
            started, our workflow looked something like this:</p>
        <ul id="write-up-text">
            <li>Cleaned and formatted the data using Pandas</li>
            <li>Built a line graph for individual patient data</li>
            <li>Created a line graph for aggregate patient trends</li>
            <li>Implemented core button functionalities</li>
            <li>Started styling the page</li>
            <li>Added interactions like line selection, tooltips, and zoom</li>
            <li>Added patient info display</li>
            <li>Wrote contextual info explaining glucose metrics</li>
            <li>Did a lot of styling tweaks and layout refinements</li>
            <li>Improved interaction behavior and responsiveness</li>
            <li>Built the write-up/info page</li>
            <li>Finalized the overall layout and design</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="write-up-text">Throughout the process, we tried to stay flexible, adjusting based on what was working and
            what wasn't, and
            always aimed to keep the user experience clean and intuitive.</p>
        <h4 id="write-up-question">How was the work split among the team members?</h4>
        <p id="write-up-text">Ryan cleaned and formatted the data using pandas into a usable form that we could work
            with. Ryan also built line graphs for both the individual patient data as well as for the aggregate patient
            trends. Shriya added interactions to these graphs such as line selection, tooltips and zoom. Throughout the
            project she improved the interaction behavior and modified it as needed to improve responsiveness. Karina
            worked on the style.css and formatting the website so that the layout was appealing to the viewers.
            Throughout the implementation of the website she made many styling tweaks to the layout, and colors so that
            the website would have a clean and common theme throughout. Audrey did outside research to choose the
            hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia thresholds and built the glucose metric information box so viewers who are
            less educated on these terms can understand what the parts of our graphs represent and why they are
            important when showing prediabetic trends.
        </p>
        <h4 id="write-up-question">Roughly how much time did we spend developing our application (in people-hours)? What
            aspects took the most time?</h4>
        <p id="write-up-text">Ryan spent around 18â€“20 hours working on the project. A large proportion of that time went
            into cleaning the data, which turned out to be more difficult than expected. Many patients had mismatched
            timestamps between their Dexcom and food log data, and there wasn't a consistent formatting standard across
            patients. All patients were time shifted to various random times, so to aggregate data, they needed to be
            time shifted back to a common date. Tracking down the bugs caused by these inconsistencies and figuring out
            how to fix them took a lot of trial and error. On top of that, there were a bunch of small issues that kept
            popping up and needed constant attention. Compared to all that, creating the charts was actually pretty
            straightforward.
            Shriya spent about 18-20 hours working on the project. Shriya thought the thing that took the most time was
            not implementing the interactive features, which was my main task, but rather fixing bugs that appeared. For
            instance when she was adding a dot tracker along the line, she had issues with it showing up outside of the
            usable space, and showing negative values. She also realized much later that because she implemented the
            zoom after coding up the thresholds, that the thresholds were not scaling with the zoom, which required
            debugging. Though I think much of the debugging process was fruitful in helping understand the intricacies
            of coding with Javascript and D3.js.
            Audrey spent about 10 hours working on the project. She spent the most time creating the patient info box
            which dynamically changes when you toggle between patients. working on outside research to figure out what
            thresholds to use for the hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia
            Karina spent about 10-12 hours working on the project. She spent the most time styling the layout and worked
            most on the style.css page. She created the healthcare theme, the color scheme, the styling of all the buttons
            such as the drop down menu, the different toggles and buttons to click on and worked on finding the best
            layout for the patient info page, as well as different sizing options for the visualiations.
